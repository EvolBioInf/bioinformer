		  From these findings it is possible to determine whether

		  development. The maximum match is a number dependent upon
		  the similarity of the wequences. One of its definitions is
		  the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can
		  be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all
		  possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While
		  the interruptions give rise to a very large number of
		  comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from
		  consideratin those comparisons that cannot contribute to
		  the maximum match. Comparisons are made from the smallest
		  unit of significance, a pair of amino caids, one from each
		  protein. All possible pairs are represented by pathways
		  through the array. For this amximum match only certain of
		  the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value,
		  one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array
		  representing like amino acids. The maximum match is the
		  largest number that would result from summing the cell
		  values of every pathway.}

		  "bootstrap" can be used to place confidence intervals on
		  phylogenies. It involves resampling points from one's own
		  dat, with replacement, to create a series of bootstrap
		  samples of the same size as the original data. Each of
		  these is analyzed, and the variation among the resulting
		  estimates taken to indicated the size of the error involved
		  in making estimates from the original data. In the case of
		  phylogenies, it is argued that the proper method of
		  resampling is to keep all of the original species while
		  sampling characters with replacement, under the assumption
		  that the characters have been independently drawn by the
		  systematist and have evolved independently. Majority-rule
		  consensus trees can be used to construct a phylogeny
		  showing all of the inferred monophyletic groups that
		  occurred in a majority of the bootstrap samples. If a group
		  shows up 95% of the time or more, the evidence for it is
		  taken to be statistically significant. Existing computer
		  programs can be used to analyze different bootstrap samples
		  by using weights on characters, the weight of a character
		  being how many times it was drawn in bootstrap sampling.
		  When all characters are perfectly compatible, as envisioned
		  by Henning, bootstrap sampling becomes unnecessary; the
		  bootstrap mehtod would show significant evidence for a
		  group if it is defined by three or more characters.}
