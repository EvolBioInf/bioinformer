 * Description: A generalized suffix tree represents all suffices of
 * a set of strings. Each node refers to the string that its label is
 * derived from. Further, each leaf indicates the positions by as
 * (stringOfOrigin,position) pairs. One purpose of generalized suffix
 * trees is to find repeats between its member strings. The code for
 * this implementation is inspired by wish to find palindromic sequences
 * in the Drosophila genome (collaboration with Thomas Wiehe). A general
 * introduction to suffix trees, which also deals with generalized
 * suffix trees can be foud in Gusfield (1997). Algorithms on Strings...,
 * Cambridge University Press.
